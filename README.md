# Applied-Statistics
Repository of my code from Kent State's Applied Statistics course

Included:
1. Code from homeworks 1-8 excluding 7, which was a handwritten homework.
2. Code from first, second, and final exams.

Purpose:
The first few regression problems are obtained from the alr4 datasets.  Homeworks 1-2 are primarily regression lines with estiomators for the slope (hatBeta1) and intercept (hatBeta0).  In homework 1, a regression line is estimated to weight based off height.  Homework 2 does takes rice prices in 2003 and uses them to predict rice prices in 2009.

Homework 3 takes the average fall temperatures (over several years) and uses them to predict winter temperatures.  It also forms a hypothesis test on the slope for fall temperature.  Next, the homework focuses on finding the relationship between mother's height on daughter's height.  To this this, it estimates the regression line para,mters as usual, but also forms a 99% confidence interval using the standard error for the slope estimate.
